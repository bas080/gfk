# Gfk assignments

# Assignment 1,2 and 4

These assignments contain tests which are defined using the assert function.
These assignments and their assertions can be run using `npm test`. When the
exit code of this command is `0`, the assertions have not thrown.

# Assignment 3

There are certain things I won't implement because of time constraints.
Regardless I have implemented the fetching and processing of the csv data, and
drawing a line that represents the values.

Requires transpilation in order to run this type `npm start` and follow the
instructions.
